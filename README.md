# scripts

There are some random programs / scripts that I wrote just to practice working
with a language. Some coding interview problems etc ... Besides that , A whole
bunch of these are probably going to be me storing away the scripts / notes I
wrote to learn the scripting languages. I still use these when I forget certain
structures or how to do a specific thing I want in another language.

Like all my other repos , this is mainly a place for me to stash my stuff and
have backups and version control. And yet , even though I am the only one who
is going to look at this repo I still sit here writing this readme as if
someone else might read this. kek.

There are some incuded scripts here that I have not written myself but still
use. I have made some minor personal customization changes to these scripts.
Ideally if a person reading this is interested, go checkout the original repos.
I link them at the top of file if I have sourced majority of the code from
somewhere.

Examples of above statement :

Rofi Monitor Layout Changer
Rofi / Commandline Youtube Browsing

https://github.com/davatorium/rofi-scripts/blob/master/monitor_layout.sh

https://github.com/sayan01/scripts/blob/master/yt

All of the ones that I use will be in the README.md for the dotfiles repo.


##Perl

I cannot find / have lost the link to the original source of the woerterbuch
perl script. I have made tiny changes to the script to personalize it a bit ,
and some quality of life stuff but if he ever finds this page and requests me
to take it down I will.
