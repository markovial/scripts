# scripts


I have not incuded scripts here that I have not written myself but still use. Examples of above statement :

https://github.com/davatorium/rofi-scripts/blob/master/monitor_layout.sh
https://github.com/sayan01/scripts/blob/master/yt

All of the ones that I use will be in the README.md for the dotfiles repo.

##Perl

I cannot find / have lost the link to the original source of the woerterbuch perl script. I have made tiny changes to the script to personalize it a bit , and some quality of life stuff but if he ever finds this page and requests me to take it down I will.
